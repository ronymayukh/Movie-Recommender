With the improvement in modern cinematography and flow of funding in the movie sector, there has been a flood in the release of movies. All movies are of different genres and of different languages, and it is quite likely that all movies cannot be liked by all. We in this paper will make a mobile application that will give the user a customised recommendation of movies and the user can also rate the movies he/she has watched. We will be using a hybrid algorithm of content based filtering and collaborative filtering for our recommendation engine. On the other end, using Jupiter notebook, we will also analyse the ratings of the movie in a live server.  We will be using numerous data visualisation techniques that we have learned throughout the course to analyse the live data that is coming from the users in the database. We will try to answer the number of ratings a movie got in its last seven months, distribution of the ratings a movie got throughout, top 10 movies, between a user selective date range. We will also use word clouds and choropleth maps to answer a few more interesting questions like which country produces the most movies and which topic is most common in the titles used by the movie makers. We will also analyse the number of movies that languages have in our dataset. We will also answer the question about which production house has the greatest number of movies, which is the most popular movie, which has the highest number of user ratings. We will also draw a network of movies based on common movies features and then use the edge-betweenness algorithm to see which cluster of movies are similar in a visual way.
